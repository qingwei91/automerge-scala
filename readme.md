## WIP

Intent: I wish to replicate [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) in scala, for learning and for fun.

I am starting by implementing some common CRDT, documented in this [survey study](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588/document)

Currently I've only implemented the following CRDT (with Test!) 

* Multi-Value Register
* Counter
